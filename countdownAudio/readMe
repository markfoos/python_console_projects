Simple countdown program asks an integer from the user. The program counts down from integer and then plays
"finalCountdown.WAV" within python using the pyaudio module. Requires separate download of
finalCountdown.WAV for full functionality. Obviously changing audio file in local path will allow other .WAV files to play
after countdown


countdownAudio.py uses time, subprocess, playsound, wave, pyaudio
